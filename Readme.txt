Flapper game!

This is a small game that combines Tapper and Wingspan together into one chaotic mess.

Instructions:
	#Customers
		- Customers will move along the table path. Each customer will be wanting to recieve a specific type of egg that you will need 
			send down the line to them. Send a customer the wrong egg and they will FREAK OUT... and you will lose a life
			
		- Once receiving an egg and customer will be pushed backwards a certain length and stand still while they hatch the egg. Once the bird is hatched, they will
			continue down the path asking for the same type of egg. This will continue until you push them backwards off screen
			
		- If a customer reaches the end of the table they will violently attack you in the safety of your own store... and you will lose a life
		
		- Customers will say what they want. The first letter will be emphysised to match the keys "A,S,D,F". You will serve a customer an "A" bird if they say
			"(A) big bird!" or a "F" bird if they say "(F)ancy bird!". Text is subject to change, but the letter system will remain.
			
		- If you send an egg down a line where nobody will recieve it, the egg will fall and hatch premiturely, flying out and attacking you... and you will lose a life
		
	#Server (ras?)
		- your job as the server is to send eggs down the line to customers. 
		
		- You must also catch birds as they are returned by customers or they will fall to the ground in a panic and attack you... and you will lose a life.
		
		- You can move up and down to each table line. Moving up at the top of the tables will loop back to the bottom and down at the bottom will loop you to the top
		
	#Levels
		- The game will take place in one scene, however the difficulty will increase after every "round". With increased difficulty, the max customer spawn, diversity of requests, and
			speed of the customers will increase
